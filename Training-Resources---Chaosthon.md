## Stage 2

It is now assumed that you have access to "Umasankar90499's project" on litmuschaos.cloud. When you are in this project, you will be doing actions as "Umasankar". It is important to keep the environment usable by other participants of Chaosthon. Do not delete the workflows that are not created by you.
When you browse the project, you see a fully configured target environment. You will see chaos workflows that ran against an agent called "eks-common". You will be running a demo chaos workflow against an application called sock-shop catalog.

### Sample application details

The sample is called sock-shop, which is installed in a namespace called "sock-shop" in a eks cluster, which is connected to your project through the eks-common agents. The details of the agents can be seen at the ChaosAgents section.

* Sockshop application is setup at http://a5d3f939433a1425e8bed9f7cf632ed4-533721864.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com/category.html 
* Catalog is a micro service that is accessible on this application

* Create a new chaos experiment against the catalog service

* Browse the catalog application when chaos is in play

* Observe the results 

## Stage 3
* Create a new chaos workflow against the same catalog experiment
In this case, we create a Pod Delete against front-end website or any other micro service in the sock-shop namespace.

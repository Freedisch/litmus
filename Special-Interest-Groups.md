## Litmus SIGs 

(as of 10/08/2020)

As the LitmusChaos project & community continue to scale, there has been a great need for area-wise focus and better roadmap/product management around how the components grow, especially with the varied nature of Litmus usage by different personas (Developers, QA, CI/CD & others DevOps functions focused engineers to SREs). Also, the integration points (with other tools, frameworks) exist across several components, which makes it important to manage these better and ensure that the monthly releases are balanced in terms of the progress made across different areas. There also has been growing interest in the community around contributions, with strong preferences for the different areas. 

As maintainers, this prompted us to come up with Special Interest Groups (inspired of course, by CNCF & Kubernetes communities) where community members align themselves around components/areas they are most interested - in terms of contributions or integration and thereby ensure the overall growth of the project. 

By definition, _SIGs oversee and coordinate the interests and needs of end-users and the project in a particular area_.

The SIGs at this point are categorized on the core functions in LitmusChaos, while some SIGs do cut across these in terms of their scope (SIG-Testing, SIG-Documentation, for example). Each SIG has:

- A dedicated charter with well-specified Goals & Non-Goals
- One or more SIG chairs/leads  
- Respective Teams in the Github Org with a set of repositories under its purview
- A meeting cadence that will help in bringing the members together to discuss and share updates on actions furthering 
  the SIG's objective in each monthly release

Some of the planned (& informally operational) SIGs with links to their charters are described below: 

- [SIG-Integrations]()
- [SIG-Observability]()
- [SIG-Deployment]()
- [SIG-CI]()
- [SIG-Testing]()
- [SIG-Documentation]()
- [SIG-Orchestration]()

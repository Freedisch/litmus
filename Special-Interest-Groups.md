# Litmus SIGs 

(as of 10/08/2020)

As the LitmusChaos project & community continue to scale, there has been a great need for area-wise focus and better roadmap/product management around how the components grow, especially with the varied nature of Litmus usage by different personas (Developers, QA, CI/CD & other DevOps-functions focused engineers to SREs). Also, the integration points (with other tools, frameworks) exist across several components, which makes it important to manage these better and ensure that the monthly releases are balanced in terms of the progress made across different areas. There also has been growing interest in the community around contributions, with strong preferences for the different areas. 

As maintainers, this prompted us to come up with Special Interest Groups (inspired of course, by CNCF & Kubernetes communities) where community members align themselves around components/areas they are most interested - in terms of contributions or integration and thereby ensure the overall growth of the project. 

By definition, _SIGs oversee and coordinate the interests and needs of end-users and the project in a particular area_.

The SIGs at this point are categorized on the core functions in LitmusChaos, while some SIGs do cut across these in terms of their scope (SIG-Testing, SIG-Documentation, for example). Each SIG has:

- A dedicated charter with well-specified Goals & Non-Goals
- One or more SIG chairs/leads  
- Respective Teams in the Github Org with a set of repositories under its purview
- A meeting cadence that will help in bringing the members together to discuss and share updates on actions furthering 
  the SIG's objective in each monthly release

Some of the planned (& informally operational) SIGs with links to their charters are described below: 

- [SIG-Integrations](https://github.com/litmuschaos/litmus/wiki/Special-Interest-Groups#sig-integrations)
- [SIG-Observability](https://github.com/litmuschaos/litmus/wiki/Special-Interest-Groups#sig-observability)
- [SIG-Deployment](https://github.com/litmuschaos/litmus/wiki/Special-Interest-Groups#sig-deployment)
- [SIG-CI](https://github.com/litmuschaos/litmus/wiki/Special-Interest-Groups#sig-ci)
- [SIG-Testing](https://github.com/litmuschaos/litmus/wiki/Special-Interest-Groups#sig-testing)
- [SIG-Documentation](https://github.com/litmuschaos/litmus/wiki/Special-Interest-Groups#sig-documentation)
- [SIG-Orchestration](https://github.com/litmuschaos/litmus/wiki/Special-Interest-Groups#sig-orchestration)
 
# SIG Details 

This section describes each SIG in detail. Each SIG is described with its own set of objectives, one or more rotating SIG-chairs, and the repositories under the SIG's purview. The SIGs are expected to become operational soon with TBD items filled up and may outgrow/themselves into new ones or merge into others, if really necessary. 

## SIG-Observability

### Note

_This SIG is expected to comprise, amongst others, of_:

 _(a) Members who are interested in improving the Litmus framework to enable observation & visualization of chaos via metrics, events,  logs, notifications & alerts )_

_(b) Members who are interested in developing plugins for integrating Litmus with other standard observability frameworks/stacks (includes agents, exporters, dashboards, etc.,_

### Goals

- Contribute requirements, use-cases to improve the notion of experiment success/failure. For Ex: (a) HTTP/Command probes that users can employ in a declarative manner to gather more decision points before calling out experiment verdicts (b) Allow for embedding contextual data into ChaosResult etc., 

- Contribute requirements, use-cases & code to improve the monitoring hooks in Litmus - such as events and metrics, i.e., the additions that need to be made to the existing set. Involves proposing and contributing enhancements to the chaos exporter logic & also evaluating, adopting (fork? ) & enhancing (if-applicable) existing OSS tools to achieve improved monitoring.

- Recommend and maintain (revisit periodically) the artifacts (Kubernetes manifests) for standard observability stacks (For ex: Elasticsearch-Fluentd-Kibana / Loki-Promtail-Grafana) with configs setup for litmus. 

- Discuss and contribute requirements around how Litmus can add value in terms of application-specific monitoring. For Ex: Newer off-the-shelf grafana dashboards that overlay litmus metrics/events against the app metrics. Say, for standard stateful apps like Kafka, Cassandra or other applications listed on the ChaosHub. 

- Contribute to the CI/E2E processes around the monitoring integrations & plugin code to maintain quality 

- Maintain developer & user documentation, demo artifacts/examples associated with usage of the respective integrations 

- Provide well-defined governance and contribution guidelines for the GitHub repositories under the purview of SIG-Observability

- Support queries in the community (slack/email) over questions and issues around chaos observability 

### Non-Goals

- Replace human decision making around experiments (the objective here is to provide the right observability aids to help the user injecting chaos in making better calls)
